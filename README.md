# Project Prerequisites
To implement this project, we will use the basic concepts of Python, Tkinter, and googletrans libraries.

Tkinter is a standard GUI Python library. ttk module gives access to the Tk themed widget set.

googletrans is a module to translate text. We import the Translator from googletrans, which is used to do translations. We also import LANGUAGES from googletrans which lists all supported languages in a Python dictionary.

To install the library, use pip install to the command prompt:

pip install tkinter pip install googletrans
